# Pokedex-Binder-Helper
Pokédex binder guide for where on each page to place each card.

For the final guide see [pokebinder.txt](./pokebinder.txt), for the code that generated it see [pokebinder.py](./pokebinder.py).
There is also a text file for a version without page resets each generation: [pokebinder-no-page-reset.txt](./pokebinder-no-page-reset.txt)

## An experiment and cautionary tale with Chat-GPT code generation
Chat-GPT was prompted for the initial code [chatgpt_out.py](./chatgpt_out.py), which gave the output [chatgpt-out.py](./chatgpt-out.py).
Unsurprisingly there were some issues with this code, and updates/customizations were easier to do myself.
Though it did a great job of introducing me to [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) with a functioning API call.
Moral of the story is, Chat-GPT is great for idea generation and for giving a starting point, but should not be treated as a source of objective truth, and good code that does what you want will require some knowledge/effort on your behalf.

The advice I like to give is **TREAT CHAT-GPT AND SIMILAR TOOLS AS SEARCH ENGINES (and sometimes as a starting point / idea generator)**.
